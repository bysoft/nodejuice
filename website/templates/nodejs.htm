Node's goal is to provide an easy way to build scalable network programs. Node tells the operating system (through epoll, kqueue, /dev/poll, or select) that it should be notified when something happens. If someone new connects, then it executes a callback, if something expires or ticks, it executes the inner callback. Each connection is only a small heap allocation.
